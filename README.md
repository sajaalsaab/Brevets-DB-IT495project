# Brevets-DB

Reimplement the RUSA ACP control time calculator with flask,
ajax and MongoDB.

## Objectives:

* Understand how can we build multiple container using Docker
  compose.
* Understand the basics of the microservices notion.

## Dependencies:

* Designed for Unix, mostly interoperable on Linux or macOS.
  May also work on Windows, but no promises. A Linux
  virtual machine may work. You may want to test on shared
  server (if available).
* You must install [docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).

## Instructions:

* You have a minimal implementation of Docker compose under the
  [todo](todo) directory. Using compose, you can connect the flask
  app to MongoDB (as demonstrated in class). We also recommend you
  look at the  `MongoCommands.md` file provided under resources in
  Blackboard.
* You will also need your `acp_times.py` from project-4. Weather
  it is 100% correct or not is not important.
* Given your version of project-4, you will add the following
  functionalities:
  * a) Create two buttons <kbd>Submit</kbd> and <kbd>Display</kbd>
    in the `brevets.html` page.
  * b) On clicking the <kbd>Submit</kbd> button, the control times
    should be entered into the database.
  * c) On clicking the <kbd>Display</kbd> button, the entries
    from the database should be displayed in a new page.
* You have to handle error cases appropriately. For example,
  "Submit" should return an error if there are no control times.
  One can imagine many such cases: you'll come up with as many cases
  as possible.
* For this project you have to use docker-compose just like the
  example we provided under the [todo](todo) directory. Meaning, 
  the database should be running on one container and the application
  on another one.
* We provided the same files found in project-4 here under the
  [brevets'](brevets) directory. Please note that the directory does
  not have a `credentials.ini` file. You have to provide it yourself for
  the application to work as it used to be. Also, you have to copy all
  the files you solved on project-4 (`acp_times.py`, `flask_brevets.py`,
  and `brevets.html`) to this project before you start.
* The `docker-compose.yml` file is not given for the [brevets'](brevets)
  directory. You have to create it yourself.

## Credentials file (credentials.ini)

The credentials file should have the following information.
```ini
# Configuration of brevets calculator.
[DEFAULT]
author=Your Name Here
repo=git@github.com:username/project-name.git
quid=411******

# the port you used within compose to map the host to the container
# for example, if the port is "5001:5000", then the PORT key should
# be 5001
PORT=5000
DEBUG = False

# See https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/quickstart/#sessions
# about how to generate a secret key
SECRET_KEY = Replace this with random string; os.urandom can make one

# the host name for your database service.
HOSTNAME= Replace this with the host name you use
```

## Grading Rubric

* **[50 Points]** A working `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` files. 
* **[50 Points]** For the tasks (a), (b), and (c). That is, you added
  the required buttons and the information is stored and retrieved from
  the database correctly.
